# United States Impact of Components in Electric and Gasoline Vehicles

<br>

## Problem Statement

<b>1. How has the demand for gasoline cars and gasoline sales been affected by the introduction and increasing adoption of electric cars over the years?</b>

<b>2. What are the differences in complexity between building electric cars and gasoline cars, and how do electric cars compare to gasoline cars in terms of mileage efficiency and pricing?</b>

<b>3. To what extent can the adoption of electric cars be attributed to the improvement of air quality, given the reduction of emissions released from gasoline cars?</b>

## Results

The project found that the introduction and increasing adoption of electric cars have had a significant impact on the demand for gasoline cars and gasoline sales. The number of gas stations decreased from 160,421 in 2010 to 127,588 in 2022, while the number of EV stations increased from 2,583 in 2010 to 140,000 in 2022. The shift towards electric cars has been driven by concerns about air quality and emissions, as well as the desire to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. As a result, the growth of EVs has had a positive impact on the environment by reducing emissions and improving air quality.

The complexity of building electric cars has reduced significantly over the years, with the quantity of components required decreasing from 2010 to the present day. It is now possible to build five times more electric cars with the same number of components as compared to 2010. Furthermore, electric cars have shown significant improvements in mileage efficiency, and they are more likely to have a better average mile compared to gasoline cars. These advancements in electric car technology have made them more affordable and accessible to a wider range of consumers, helping to drive their adoption and reduce the dependence on gasoline cars.

The adoption of electric cars has contributed to the improvement of air quality, as demonstrated by the reduction in emissions from gasoline cars. The growth of electric cars has led to a decline in sales of gasoline cars and a drastic reduction in CO, NOx, and HC emissions from gasoline cars, as shown through visualizations of total car sales. Electric cars have become more accessible and affordable to consumers due to advancements in technology, which have reduced the complexity of building them and increased their mileage efficiency. As electric cars produce zero emissions, they are a cleaner alternative to gasoline cars, and this shift towards electric cars is driven by concerns, as well as the desire to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

## Conclusion
<br>
The project concludes that the adoption of electric cars has had a significant impact on the demand for gasoline cars and gasoline sales, and it has contributed to the improvement of air quality. Electric cars have become more accessible and affordable due to advancements in technology, which have reduced the complexity of building them and increased their mileage efficiency. The project recommends that further research be conducted to investigate the potential impact of electric cars on the US economy and the implications of a potential shift towards electric cars on the oil industry.
